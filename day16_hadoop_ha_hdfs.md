# ðŸ“˜ Day 16 â€“ Hadoop High Availability & HDFS Write Path

## ðŸ”· Secondary NameNode
- NOT a backup for NameNode
- Periodically pulls fsimage and edits files
- Merges them to create updated fsimage
- Helps in reducing NameNode restart time

## ðŸ”· Standby NameNode
- Passive node that stays in sync with active NameNode
- Part of Hadoop High Availability (HA) configuration
- Uses shared storage (e.g., NFS) and fencing to avoid split-brain
- Takes over automatically on failure of active NameNode

## ðŸ”· Hadoop High Availability (HA) Architecture
- Active/Standby NameNode pair
- JournalNode quorum for shared edit logs
- Zookeeper for failover coordination
- Ensures 0 downtime in critical environments

## ðŸ”· HDFS Write Request Flow (Simplified)
1. Client contacts NameNode to get block locations
2. NameNode responds with available DataNodes
3. Client writes data â†’ pipeline formed across DataNodes
4. Acknowledgments returned from each DataNode
5. NameNode updates block metadata

> Each block replicated (default: 3 times) across different racks
