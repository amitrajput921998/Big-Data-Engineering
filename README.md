# 🚀 My Big Data Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal learning journey into the world of **Big Data**, where I'm diving deep into **SQL, Python, GCP, Azure**, and various **data engineering concepts**. I'm documenting everything I learn, practice, and build — one day at a time.

## 🗓️ Daily Learning Progress

### ✅ **Day 1 – Introduction to Big Data Engineering**
- Understood the role and responsibilities of a Big Data Engineer.
- Explored real-world use cases.
- Set up my learning goals and plan.

### ✅ **Day 2 – SQL Basics**
- Created databases and tables.
- Inserted, updated, and deleted records.
- Practiced DML operations and table alterations.

### ✅ **Day 3 – Constraints and Indexes**
- Learned about Primary Key, Foreign Key, Unique, Not Null, and Check constraints.
- Explored Indexing and Candidate Keys.

### ✅ **Day 4 – SQL Joins**
- Practiced INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER, and CROSS JOINs.
- Understood data relationships and merging tables.

### ✅ **Day 5 – Subqueries**
- Worked with single-row, multi-row, nested, and correlated subqueries.
- Learned how subqueries can solve complex logic within SQL.

### ✅ **Day 6 – Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**
- Simplified queries using CTEs.
- Explored recursive CTEs for hierarchical data.

### ✅ **Day 7 – Window Functions**
- Practiced ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK().
- Used PARTITION BY and ORDER BY within the OVER() clause.

### ✅ **Day 8 – Python Revision Begins**
- Reviewed Python basics: syntax, variables, data types, loops, conditionals, functions, and collections (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries).
- Code and notes uploaded in this repository.

✅ **Day 9 – Python Functional Programming & File Handling**
- Learned Lambda functions, `map()`, and `filter()` for cleaner and faster operations.
- Explored Python modules, the standard library, and importing techniques.
- Practiced file operations: reading, writing, and working with file paths.
- Understood and implemented exception handling to build error-resilient programs.
- Code and examples added to the repository.
